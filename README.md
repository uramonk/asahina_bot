# asahina_bot

asahina_bot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

This README is intended to help get you started. Definitely update and improve
to talk about your own instance, how to use and deploy, what functionality he
has, etc!

### Running asahina_bot Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely
upon have been set.

You can start asahina_bot locally by running:

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:6379
    asahina_bot>

Then you can interact with asahina_bot by typing `asahina_bot help`.

    asahina_bot> asahina_bot help
    asahina_bot animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds [snip]
    asahina_bot help - Displays all of the help commands that asahina_bot knows about.
    ...
